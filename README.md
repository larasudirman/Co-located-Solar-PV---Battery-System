This project explores the economic viability and revenue potential of combining solar photovoltaic (PV) systems with battery storage in the UK's electricity market. Using the PyPSA tool, the study models and optimizes the integration of these technologies, focusing on maximizing returns through day-ahead energy arbitrage and participation in the Balancing Mechanism. The project identifies optimal battery capacities and examines how factors like costs and market conditions impact financial performance. The findings demonstrate that co-locating battery storage with solar PV can significantly enhance the profitability of renewable energy projects, offering valuable insights for optimizing these systems in a sustainable and economically efficient manner.
